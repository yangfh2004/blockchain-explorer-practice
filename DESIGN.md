# System Design

Describe the design of your solution.

Feel free to use your own structure or template and be sure to address at the very least:

- What are the major components?

- How do they interact?

- How does your solution scale?

- What are some of the tradeoffs you made?

- What are some of the things you would do differently if you had more time?

- How does your solution handle receiving blocks out-of-order?
